        <p>
           The Triple Gooberberry Sunrise is an ice cream sundae served at Goofy Goober's Ice Cream Party Boat.
           It is two or three scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce "hair" and a banana with a cherry on top hat. It has two banana and red cherry arms and three candy buttons for eyes and a nose with a big red licorice smile.
           It appears to give its consumers intoxication-like symptoms, as seen by the aftermath of SpongeBob and Patrick's consumption of the ice cream.

            <li>Ice</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        Assemble Ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>2 bananas, peeled and halved</li>
            <li>3 cherries</li>
            <li>3 M&Ms</li>
            <li>1 licorice string</li>
            <li>Chocolate fudge</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Into a large pot, whisk to combine 1 cup of whole milk and 15 grams of non-diastatic malt powder. Once fully incorporated, add in 2 cups of heavy cream. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Separately add 15 grams carrageenan to 1 cup of sugar. Whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Once combined, add the carrageenan and sugar mixture to the pot then whisking until dissolved. Bring to a bare simmer.</li>
            <li>Stir frequently to make sure the milk doesn’t scorch. Kill the heat once bubbles form.</li>
            <li>Into a heatproof bowl, goes 5 large egg yolks. Wrap with a damp towel. Whisk together while slowly ladling in the hot milk and cream mixture.</li>
            <li>Start slow, then by the 3rd or 4th ladle, the eggs should be tempered and the milk and cream can be added faster.</li>
            <li>In total, ⅓ of the milk and cream mixture should be whisked in before adding back into the large pot of hot milk and cream mixture. </li>
            <li>Over medium-low heat, bring the mixture up to 185°F and whisk constantly to make sure nothing is scrambling on the bottom of the pot. The mixture is done once it is 185°F or the liquid coats the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>After killing the heat, add in 2 ounces of whiskey plus the sliced and scraped insides of 1 vanilla bean.</li>
            <li>Place a smaller bowl into a larger bowl filled with salted ice and water. Pour the custard into the smaller bowl and whisk occasionally for 10 minutes until it reaches 72°F. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or until fully chilled. </li>
            <li>Once chilled, churn the custard via the preferred churning method of choice. Remember to remove the vanilla pod.</li>
            <li>Churn for about 35 minutes or until a consistency of firm soft served. Scrape into a freezer-safe container (optionally press a layer of wax paper to prevent freezer burn) and freeze for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>

        Assembly Instructions:
        <ol>
            <li>Start by peeling 2 bananas and slicing them in half and repeatedly skewering with toothpicks before placing in the freezer for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In an ice cream bowl goes 3 large scoops of ice cream. Place in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a generous dollop of cooled fudge on top of the top scoop and top with a slice of the banana then place 1 slice of banana on each side of the middle scoop.</li>
            <li>For the face, place three different colored M&M’s on the top scoop along with a small licorice string for the smile. </li>
            <li>To finish, place 3 cherries on the skewered end of each banana. </li>
        </ol>
