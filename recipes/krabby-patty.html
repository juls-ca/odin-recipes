    <p>First up, Krusty Krab's signature burger: the <b>Krabby Patty</b>.
        The Krabby Patty is the Krusty Krab's signature food item.
        It is a meatless hamburger of sorts made from seaweed-sea buns, undersea vegetables, condiments, and a patty; it can also be ordered with cheese.
        The ingredients of the patty itself are purposely kept secret throughout the series, but creator Stephen Hillenburg had stated that the patties are entirely vegetarian.
        It was created by Mr. Krabs and Plankton. It is the best-known item at the restaurant and the most famous food in Bikini Bottom.
        It first appears in "Help Wanted" and is what SpongeBob cooks most of the time at his job.
        The Krabby Patty is a basic plot element that contributes to the Krusty Krab's existence.
        A running gag throughout the series is Plankton coming up with plans to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula, but always failing.</p>
