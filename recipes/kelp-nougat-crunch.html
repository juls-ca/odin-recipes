            Kelp Nougat Crunch is a candy bar sold in the Kandy Machine, located in Rock Bottom.
            Fun fact: when it is seen from afar, the text reads "goo" instead of "kelp."
            The candy bar itself appears to be in a deep grayish-green color.

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            Serves 8-12
            Rice Crispy Layer Method:
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare a quarter baking sheet  (13 in x 9 in) with a layer of parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper with nonstick spray.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a large pot and cook it over medium-low heat until the milk solids begin to brown, about 4-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the marshmallows and stir until they are melted and the mixture is homogenous.</li>
                <li>In the same pot, combine the marshmallow mixture, rice cereal, and salt. Fold the mixture together until homogenous.</li>
                <li>Deposit the rice crispy mixture into the prepared baking sheet and spread it into an even layer. Allow the layer to cool and harden, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            Nori Nougat Center Method:
            <ol>
                <li>Add the egg whites, cream of tartar, and 50 grams of glucose syrup to the bowl of a stand mixer and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl combine the milk powder, wakame powder, and powdered sugar. Using a small sieve, sift the dry ingredients and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a small high-sided pot, combine the remaining glucose syrup, sugar, and water.</li>
                <li>Begin cooking the sugar mixture in the small pot. Make sure to brush down the sides of the pot with a wet pastry brush until the mixture is rapidly boiling.</li>
                <li>Using a candy thermometer, monitor the temperature of the cooking sugar syrup until it reaches 235 °F, then begin running the mixer with the prepared egg white mixture to high speed.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking the sugar syrup until it reaches 250 °F, by this point, the egg white mixture should be at stiff peaks. If the egg whites reach stiff peaks before the sugar syrup is at the correct temperature, turn the mixer to low speed. If the egg whites have not reached stiff peaks by the time the sugar syrup is at the correct temperature, turn off the heat on the sugar syrup and wait until the egg white have whipped to stiff peaks before adding the syrup.</li>
                <li>With the mixer running on medium speed, slowly pour the sugar syrup down the side of the bowl, being careful to avoid the whisk attachment.</li>
                <li>Once all of the sugar syrup is incorporated, turn the mixer to high speed and continue mixing for 8 minutes. The nougat should be thick and glossy. Make sure the nougat does not fall below 140 °F before depositing, otherwise it will be too thick and sticky to spread.</li>
                <li>Add the vanilla paste while the mixture is still running, then turn off the mixer and fold in the reserved dry ingredients using a large heat-proof spatula.</li>
                <li>Deposit the nougat mixture over the rice crispy layer. Using a lightly-oiled offset spatula, spread the mixture into a relatively flat and even layer.</li>
                <li>Cover the entire surface of the nougat with the nori sheets. Allow the nougat to cool to room temperature and solidify, about 1 ½ - 2 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            Kelp Nougat Crunch Bar Method:
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare a large baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Unmold the rice crispy/nougat center onto a cutting board, making sure to peel off the parchment paper in the process.</li>
                <li>Using a lightly-oiled knife, cut the filling into candy bars about 1.5 inches wide and 4 inches long. </li>
                <li>Optionally, color the white chocolate with green food coloring.</li>
                <li>Dip the candy fillings into the white chocolate using two forks. Carefully shake off any excess chocolate and transfer the coated bars to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Allow the chocolate bars to set, about 30 minutes. Store the candy bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. After 2 days, the nougat center will reach optimal texture.</li>
            </ol>
