    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh ginger finely minced or grated (or use paste)</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic finely minced or crushed</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds about 2-3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into ¾-inch chunks</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste or 8 oz can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon  or paprika, adjust to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>Hot cooked rice and naan for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Let's cook!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat a large skillet or medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the oil, butter, and onions and cook onions down until lightly golden, about 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and let cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the chicken, tomato paste, and spices. Cook for 5-6 minutes or until everything is cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the heavy cream and simmer for 8-10 minutes stirring occasionally. Serve over Basmati rice or with naan.
